# Security

## Session Model

- Session tokens are generated with `crypto/rand` as 21 random bytes encoded
  with unpadded base64url (`[A-Za-z0-9_-]{28}`). Standard base64 characters
  `+`, `/`, and padding `=` are rejected.
- The raw session token is never stored. It is HMAC-SHA256 hashed with
  `SESSION_HASH_SECRET`; that private HMAC value is the session row's primary
  key and is never exposed through the API.
- Each session also has a random public UUID used for listing and remote
  revocation. Exposing this identifier does not expose the cookie token or its
  HMAC.
- The `session` cookie is `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, `Secure` (when TLS is detected or `TRUST_PROXY=true` and `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`), `Path=/`, `Max-Age=604800` (7 days).
- On every authenticated request, `RefreshSession` refreshes the sliding TTL only when the session is within the inner half of the TTL window (`expires_at < now + TTL/2`); sessions in the outer half are still validated but not re-stamped. Sessions expire 7 days after last use or 30 days (720 h, configurable via `SESSION_ABSOLUTE_TTL_HOURS`) after creation, whichever comes first.
- A background goroutine sweeps expired sessions from PostgreSQL every hour.
- Password changes revoke all other sessions for the user atomically in a single transaction.
- Each user is limited to 100 sessions. Session creation is serialized per user
  and removes the oldest excess rows, bounding listing and storage work.
- Active-session listing and revocation derive the user and current token from
  authenticated request state. Remote revocation uses an ownership-constrained
  database delete, returns the same not-found result for missing and unowned
  UUIDs, and refuses to revoke the current session. Current-session termination
  remains the logout operation.

## Password Policy

- Minimum 8 characters, maximum 1024 characters.
- Hashed with Argon2id PHC format: `memory=19456 KiB`, `iterations=2`, `parallelism=1`, `saltSize=16 bytes`, `hashSize=32 bytes`.
- Concurrent hash operations are bounded by a semaphore (default 4, configurable via `ARGON_MAX_CONCURRENCY`) to cap memory usage (~19 MiB per hash). Requests waiting for a hash slot honor request cancellation.
- Hashes are upgraded silently to current parameters on next login (`NeedsRehash` check).
- A pre-computed decoy hash is verified when the email is not found, preventing timing-oracle user enumeration.

## Ownership Rules

| Operation | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| Update user profile | `userId` path param must equal session `userID` (checked in handler) |
| Delete post | `WHERE public_id = $1 AND user_id = $2` (atomic in DB) |
| Delete comment | `WHERE public_id = $1 AND id = $2 AND user_id = $3` (atomic in DB) |
| Revoke remote session | Atomic delete constrained by `public_id` and authenticated `user_id`; missing and unowned IDs both return 404 |
| Follow/unfollow self | Blocked at service layer (`currentUserID == targetUserID`) |
| Read email field | Stripped in handler unless requester is the user |
| Upload image | Registered to `userID`; consumed atomically at post/avatar creation |

## What Is Protected

- All routes except `POST /sessions`, `POST /users`, `GET /health`, `GET /ready`, and `OPTIONS` require a valid session cookie.
- Adding a new public route requires explicit registration before the `RequireSession` middleware wrapper.

## Rate Limiting

- Token bucket per policy, keyed by user id > session cookie > client IP.
- Implemented as a Lua script on Dragonfly (atomic HMGET + HMSET + PEXPIRE).
- `TRUST_PROXY=true` honors `X-Forwarded-For` for IP extraction; disabled by default.
- Failure mode: configurable via `RATE_LIMIT_FAIL_OPEN` (default false → fail-closed on Dragonfly error); fail-closed returns HTTP 503. `RATE_LIMIT_FAIL_OPEN` applies only to the token-bucket rate limiter.
- Login throttle uses separate per-IP (5 failures) and per-email (50 failures) counters in Dragonfly with 15 min TTL, cleared on successful login. When Dragonfly is unavailable, the login throttle always fails open regardless of `RATE_LIMIT_FAIL_OPEN`.

## Upload Security

- Frontend upload and avatar actions reject files over 1 MB and MIME types
  outside JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WEBP before proxying bytes to the backend. These
  checks are usability and load-shedding controls; the backend remains the
  authoritative validator.
- File content is validated against magic bytes (not extension or MIME header): JPEG `\xff\xd8\xff`, PNG `\x89PNG\r\n\x1a\n`, GIF `GIF8`, WEBP `RIFF....WEBP`.
- Multipart read is bounded to 1 MB + 1 byte; files exceeding 1 MB are rejected before any further processing.
- All accepted images are decoded and re-encoded to JPEG at 90% quality. Re-encoding strips embedded metadata (EXIF, GPS coordinates, ICC profiles) and eliminates polyglot payloads that pass the magic byte check. Re-encoded output is rejected if it exceeds 1 MB.
- Pixel dimensions are checked via `image.DecodeConfig` before full decode; images exceeding 25 MP (e.g. 5000×5000) are rejected to guard against decompression bombs.
- All stored images have content type `image/jpeg` regardless of the original upload format.
- Filenames are 32 lowercase hex characters generated from `crypto/rand`.
- File serving validates the path segment against the 32-char hex pattern before proxying.

## HTTP Security Headers (backend)

- `X-XSS-Protection: 0` (legacy auditor disabled; CSP takes over)
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`
- `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data: blob:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; script-src 'self'; font-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self'`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` when the request is HTTPS or trusted forwarded HTTPS

## HTTP Security Headers (frontend)

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` for HTTPS requests
- SvelteKit nonce-based `Content-Security-Policy`: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'` plus nonce; `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: blob:; connect-src 'self'; font-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self'`

## Search Filter Injection Prevention

- Hashtag filter values are validated against `^[A-Za-z0-9_]{1,50}$` before being interpolated into Meilisearch filter strings.
- All other query parameters are passed as structured JSON fields, never as raw filter fragments.

## CSRF Protection

- `OriginGuard` middleware rejects mutating requests where `Origin` does not match the request host.
- `SameSite=Strict` cookie blocks cross-site form submission.

## Meilisearch Key Isolation

- The master key is used once at startup to provision a scoped API key with only `search`, `documents.add`, and `documents.delete` actions.
- All subsequent Meilisearch operations use the scoped key; the master key is not retained in memory.
