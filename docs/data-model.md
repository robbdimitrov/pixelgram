## Entity Definitions

### users
| Field | Type | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| id | serial PK | auto-increment |
| name | varchar(255) | NOT NULL |
| username | varchar(30) | UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK `^[a-z0-9._]{3,30}$` |
| email | varchar(255) | UNIQUE, NOT NULL |
| password | varchar(255) | NOT NULL — Argon2id PHC hash |
| avatar | varchar(255) | DEFAULT `''` — blob filename |
| bio | varchar(300) | DEFAULT `''` |
| follower_count | int | NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 — atomically maintained by follow/unfollow mutations within their transactions |
| created | timestamptz | DEFAULT now() |

### sessions
| Field | Type | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| id | varchar(255) PK | Private HMAC-SHA256 hash of the raw session token; never exposed |
| public_id | uuid | UNIQUE, NOT NULL, DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() — listing and revocation identifier |
| user_id | integer FK → users | NOT NULL, ON DELETE CASCADE |
| created | timestamptz | NOT NULL |
| expires_at | timestamptz | NOT NULL |

### uploads
Staging table for image blobs before they become a post or avatar. A row is consumed (deleted) atomically when a post or avatar update references it.

| Field | Type | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| filename | varchar(255) PK | 32-char lowercase hex |
| user_id | integer FK → users | NOT NULL, ON DELETE CASCADE |
| created | timestamptz | NOT NULL |

### posts
| Field | Type | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| id | serial PK | |
| public_id | uuid UNIQUE | DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() — external identifier |
| user_id | integer FK → users | NOT NULL, ON DELETE CASCADE |
| filename | varchar(255) | NOT NULL — blob filename |
| description | varchar(1000) | nullable |
| created | timestamptz | NOT NULL |

### likes
| Field | Type | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| post_id | integer FK → posts | NOT NULL, ON DELETE CASCADE |
| user_id | integer FK → users | NOT NULL, ON DELETE CASCADE |
| created | timestamptz | NOT NULL |
| — | PRIMARY KEY(post_id, user_id) | |

### comments
| Field | Type | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| id | serial PK | |
| post_id | integer FK → posts | ON DELETE CASCADE |
| user_id | integer FK → users | ON DELETE CASCADE |
| body | varchar(400) | CHECK char_length > 0 |
| created | timestamptz | NOT NULL |

### hashtags
| Field | Type | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| id | serial PK | |
| name | varchar(50) UNIQUE | NOT NULL — lowercase |
| created | timestamptz | NOT NULL |

### post_hashtags
| Field | Type | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| post_id | integer FK → posts | NOT NULL, ON DELETE CASCADE |
| hashtag_id | integer FK → hashtags | NOT NULL, ON DELETE CASCADE |
| created | timestamptz | NOT NULL |
| — | PRIMARY KEY(post_id, hashtag_id) | |

### follows
| Field | Type | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| follower_id | integer FK → users | NOT NULL, ON DELETE CASCADE |
| followee_id | integer FK → users | NOT NULL, ON DELETE CASCADE |
| created | timestamptz | NOT NULL |
| — | PRIMARY KEY(follower_id, followee_id) | |

### notifications
| Field | Type | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| id | bigserial PK | auto-increment |
| external_id | varchar(255) UNIQUE | NOT NULL — idempotency key (outbox row id carried through Kafka) |
| user_id | bigint FK → users | NOT NULL, ON DELETE CASCADE — recipient |
| actor_id | bigint FK → users | NOT NULL, ON DELETE CASCADE — who triggered the event |
| type | varchar(20) | NOT NULL — `like`, `comment`, or `follow` |
| entity_id | varchar(255) | NOT NULL — post public_id, comment id, or actor user id |
| read | boolean | NOT NULL DEFAULT false |
| created | timestamptz | NOT NULL DEFAULT now() |

### outbox
Transactional outbox for Redpanda. Written in the same transaction as the entity mutation; Redpanda Connect reads new rows via WAL CDC and publishes to the appropriate topic. Payloads are generated with `encoding/json` from typed backend structs so control characters and quotes are encoded as valid JSON. Append-only; rows are never updated or deleted by the relay. A periodic cleanup removes rows older than 7 days.

| Field | Type | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| id | bigserial PK | |
| topic | varchar(50) | NOT NULL — `entity-changes` or `activity` |
| payload | jsonb | NOT NULL — event payload |
| created | timestamptz | NOT NULL DEFAULT now() |

### feed
Pre-materialized feed table. Populated by the `feed-consumer` on post creation (fan-out on write) and follow events. `ON DELETE CASCADE` on both FKs handles cleanup automatically when a post or user is deleted.

| Field | Type | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| user_id | bigint FK → users | NOT NULL, ON DELETE CASCADE |
| post_id | bigint FK → posts | NOT NULL, ON DELETE CASCADE |
| created | timestamptz | NOT NULL |
| — | PRIMARY KEY (user_id, post_id) | |

## Meilisearch Indexes

| Index | Searchable | Filterable | Sortable | Primary key |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| users | username, name | — | — | id (string, stringified int) |
| posts | description, username | hashtags | created | id (post public_id UUID) |
| hashtags | name | — | post_count | id (hashtag name) |

## Domain Invariants

- A post's `filename` is consumed from `uploads` atomically at creation; an orphaned upload is never used for a post.
- A user's `avatar` must either be blank, equal to an existing `users.avatar` or `posts.filename` owned by the same user, or a valid pending `upload`. The old avatar blob is deleted from object storage if no other entity references it.
- Deleting a post clears `users.avatar` for any user whose avatar references the post's filename.
- A session token is stored only as its private HMAC-SHA256 `id`; the raw token
  lives only in the cookie. The independent UUID `public_id` is safe to expose
  for session listing and ownership-constrained revocation.
- Session creation is serialized on the owning user row and retains at most the
  100 newest sessions per user.
- Hashtag names are lowercased and de-duplicated before storage; they are created idempotently (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`).
- `follows(follower_id, followee_id)` is inserted with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`; self-follow is blocked at the service layer.
- `feed(user_id, post_id)` inserts use `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`; post-deletion rows are removed by `ON DELETE CASCADE`, not by the consumer.
- `notifications` inserts use `ON CONFLICT (external_id) DO NOTHING`; `external_id` is the outbox row id relayed through Kafka, ensuring idempotent replay.
