# API

All endpoints are served by the Go backend on port 8080. All responses are JSON. Error bodies are `{"message": "..."}`.

## Middleware Stack (outermost → innermost)

1. `RequestID` — accepts `X-Request-ID` (max 64 chars; generates a new 16-byte hex id if absent or over the limit) and echoes it in the response header.
2. `Logger` — structured JSON request log with method, route pattern, path, status, duration.
3. `SecurityHeaders` — sets `X-XSS-Protection: 0`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data: blob:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; script-src 'self'; font-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self'`, and `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` on HTTPS or trusted forwarded HTTPS requests.
4. `OriginGuard` — for POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, rejects requests where `Origin` header is present but does not match the request host.
5. `RateLimit` — token bucket via Dragonfly Lua script; key priority: user id > session cookie > client IP.
6. `RequireSession` — validates `session` cookie; refreshes sliding TTL; injects `userID` into context. Exempt: `POST /sessions`, `POST /users`, `GET /health`, `OPTIONS`.

## Rate Limit Policies

Defaults are overridable via env vars `RATE_LIMIT_{POLICY}_{BURST,RATE}`.

## Endpoint Inventory

### Public (no auth required)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | /health | Liveness check — 204 No Content |
| GET | /ready | Readiness check — pings PostgreSQL (2 s timeout) |
| POST | /users | Create account — returns `{"username": "..."}` on 201 |
| POST | /sessions | Login — sets `session` cookie, returns `{"username": "..."}` on 201 |
| GET | /uploads/ | Serve uploaded file blob |

### Protected (session cookie required)

#### Sessions
| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | /sessions | List the authenticated user's active sessions |
| DELETE | /sessions | Logout — clears session cookie |
| DELETE | /sessions/{sessionId} | Revoke one remote session by public UUID |

`GET /sessions` returns active sessions newest first:

```json
{
  "sessions": [
    {
      "id": "01904d2e-7f4d-7c33-ae21-2f94737eaa10",
      "created": "2026-06-22T12:00:00Z",
      "expiresAt": "2026-06-29T12:00:00Z",
      "current": true
    }
  ]
}
```

The `id` field is the session's public UUID, not the raw cookie token or its
private HMAC database key. The list includes only sessions owned by the
authenticated user that remain within both the sliding expiry and absolute
lifetime. `expiresAt` is the earlier of those two limits. Accounts retain at
most 100 sessions, so the response is bounded. Responses are `200`; repository
failures return `500`.

`DELETE /sessions/{sessionId}` validates `sessionId` as a UUID and deletes only
a session owned by the authenticated user. It returns `204` on success, `400`
for a malformed UUID, `404` when the session is missing or belongs to another
user, `409` when it identifies the current session, and `500` on repository
failure. Use `DELETE /sessions` to terminate the current session.

#### Users
| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | /users/me | Get current authenticated user |
| GET | /users/{username} | Get user by username |
| PUT | /users/me | Update profile or change password |
| GET | /users/{username}/followers | List followers (cursor-paginated) |
| GET | /users/{username}/following | List following (cursor-paginated) |
| POST | /users/{username}/follow | Follow a user |
| DELETE | /users/{username}/follow | Unfollow a user |

#### Discovery
| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | /users/suggested | Get up to 10 suggested users to follow |
| GET | /posts/popular | Get up to 20 popular posts from the last 7 days |

`GET /users/suggested` returns users ordered by `follower_count` descending, excluding users the authenticated user already follows and the authenticated user themselves. Response:

```json
{"items": [<user>]}
```

`GET /posts/popular` returns posts from the last 7 days ordered by like count descending, up to 20 results. Response:

```json
{"items": [<post>]}
```

#### Feed
| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | /feed | Get the authenticated user's feed (cursor-paginated) |

`GET /feed` returns posts from the feed table for the authenticated user, ordered `(created DESC, id DESC)`. Response shape matches the post list shape. Returns an empty items array (not an error) when the feed is empty.

#### Posts
| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | /posts | Create post from an upload |
| GET | /posts/{publicId} | Get single post |
| DELETE | /posts/{publicId} | Delete own post |
| POST | /posts/{publicId}/likes | Like a post |
| DELETE | /posts/{publicId}/likes | Unlike a post |
| GET | /users/{username}/posts | List user's posts (cursor-paginated) |
| GET | /users/{username}/likes | List user's liked posts (cursor-paginated) |

#### Comments
| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | /posts/{publicId}/comments | List comments on a post (cursor-paginated) |
| POST | /posts/{publicId}/comments | Create a comment |
| DELETE | /posts/{publicId}/comments/{commentId} | Delete own comment |

#### Uploads
| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | /uploads | Upload an image file; returns `{filename}` |

#### Search
| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | /users/search?q= | Typeahead user search (up to 8 results) |
| GET | /hashtags/search?q= | Typeahead hashtag search (up to 8 results) |
| GET | /search?q=&type=&cursor= | Full search — type: `users`, `posts`, or `hashtags`; requires Meilisearch |

#### Notifications
| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | /notifications | List notifications for the authenticated user (cursor-paginated) |
| PUT | /notifications/{id}/read | Mark one notification as read |

`GET /notifications` returns cursor-paginated notifications ordered `(created DESC, id DESC)`:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 42,
      "externalId": "activity-0-1234",
      "userId": 7,
      "actorId": 3,
      "type": "like",
      "entityId": "01904d2e-7f4d-7c33-ae21-2f94737eaa10",
      "read": false,
      "created": "2026-06-22T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "nextCursor": null
}
```

Notification types: `like` (entityId = post public_id), `comment` (entityId = comment id), `follow` (entityId = actor user id as string).

`PUT /notifications/{id}/read` requires `id` to be a positive integer. Returns `204` on success, `400` for an invalid ID, and `500` on repository failure. Ownership is enforced in the UPDATE query.

## Pagination Model

- All paginated endpoints accept `cursor` (base64url-encoded JSON `{created, id}`) and `limit` (1–50, default 10; values above 50 are silently clamped to 50) query parameters.
- Response shape: `{"items": [...], "nextCursor": "<string or null>"}`.
- `page` parameter is rejected (returns 400).
- Ordering: `(created DESC, id DESC)` throughout.

## Search Endpoint (`GET /search`)

- `type=posts`: full-text search on description and username; supports `q=#hashtag` to filter by hashtag (exact match via Meilisearch filter).
- `type=users`: full-text search on username and name.
- `type=hashtags`: full-text search on name.
- Cursor encodes a Meilisearch offset (base64-encoded integer string); page size is 20.
- Returns 503 if Meilisearch is not configured.
- Query must be 1–50 UTF-8 runes.

## User Object Shape

User objects returned by `/users/me`, `/users/{username}`, follower/following lists, and suggested users share this shape:

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "name": "Alice",
  "username": "alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "avatar": null,
  "bio": null,
  "posts": 12,
  "likes": 34,
  "followers": 5,
  "following": 3,
  "isFollowing": false,
  "created": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

`id` is the user's public UUID (`public_id` column). The internal integer primary key is never exposed. `email` is stripped from user responses unless the requester's session belongs to that user.
