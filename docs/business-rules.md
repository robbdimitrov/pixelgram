# Business Rules

## User Registration

- Name: required, trimmed.
- Username: 3–30 chars, `^[a-z0-9._]+$`, normalized to lowercase. Unique across all users.
- Email: matches `^[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\.[^@\s]+$`, normalized to lowercase. Unique across all users.
- Password: 8–1024 bytes.
- Duplicate username or email returns 409 Conflict.

## Profile Updates

- Name and username required.
- Username and email must satisfy same format rules as registration.
- Bio: max 300 Unicode code points.
- Avatar update: the provided filename must be a pending upload owned by the user, or the user's current avatar, or a filename already used in one of the user's posts. Any other value rolls back the transaction.
- Old avatar blob is deleted from object storage if no post or user still references it.

## Password Change

- Both current password and new password are required.
- Current password is verified with constant-time Argon2id comparison before accepting the new hash.
- All sessions other than the current one are deleted atomically in the same transaction.

## Image Upload

- One pending upload per user per call. Expired uploads (rows older than 1 hour) are deleted before a new one is created.
- Backend enforces 1 MB multipart limit via `io.LimitReader`.
- Frontend targets < 900 KB by resizing (canvas JPEG re-encode, quality steps from 0.88 to 0.60, scale steps of 0.85×, min dimension 320 px).
- Accepted formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WEBP (magic byte validation).

## Post Creation

- The provided filename must reference a pending upload owned by the current user. The upload row is deleted atomically in the same transaction.
- Description: optional, max 1000 Unicode code points.
- Hashtags are extracted with `#([A-Za-z0-9_]{1,50})`, lowercased, de-duplicated in first-occurrence order, and stored in `hashtags` and `post_hashtags`.

## Post Deletion

- Only the post's owner can delete it.
- Deleting a post clears `users.avatar` for any user whose avatar matches the post's filename.
- The associated blob is deleted from object storage after the database transaction commits.

## Comments

- Body: required, trimmed, 1–400 Unicode code points.
- Only the comment author can delete a comment.
- `ListComments` returns 404 if the post does not exist.

## Likes

- `LikePost` checks post existence first; returns 404 if not found.
- `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` makes liking idempotent.
- Unliking a non-liked post is a no-op (no error).

## Feed Logic

The feed reads from a pre-materialized `feed` table populated by the `feed-consumer`:

- **Post created**: one feed row is inserted per follower of the author, plus one for the author themselves. Uses `ON CONFLICT (user_id, post_id) DO NOTHING` for idempotency.
- **Post deleted**: handled entirely by `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `feed.post_id` — no consumer action.
- **Follow**: the last 50 posts by the followed user are backfilled into the follower's feed.
- **Unfollow**: all feed rows where the post's author is the unfollowed user are pruned from the follower's feed.
- A new user's feed is empty until they follow someone or create a post.

## Celebrity / Hybrid Fanout

- **Celebrity threshold**: users with `follower_count > 10000` skip fan-out-on-write; only their own feed row is written at post creation time.
- **Hybrid read**: celebrity posts are merged into each viewer's feed at query time via `UNION ALL` with `NOT EXISTS` dedup against the fan-out inbox, ensuring no duplicate entries appear when both paths would otherwise produce the same row.

## Notifications

Notifications are created and deleted by the `notifications-consumer` from the `activity` topic. The `entity-changes` topic is also consumed for post-deletion cleanup. Self-events are never notified.

**Creation** (all skip if `actor_id == recipient_id`):
- Like: notify the post owner (`type=like`, `entity_id=post_public_id`).
- Comment: notify the post owner (`type=comment`, `entity_id=comment_id`).
- Follow: notify the followee (`type=follow`, `entity_id=actor_id as string`).

All inserts use `ON CONFLICT (external_id) DO NOTHING` for idempotency.

**Deletion**:
- Unlike: delete the matching like notification for the actor and post.
- Comment deleted: delete the matching comment notification by `entity_id=comment_id`.
- Unfollow: delete the matching follow notification for the actor and recipient.
- Post deleted: delete all `like` and `comment` notifications where `entity_id=post_public_id`.

## Search Query Rules

- Query length: 1–50 UTF-8 rune count (validated before hitting Meilisearch or PostgreSQL).
- `GET /search?type=posts&q=#tag` filters by exact hashtag match; the tag is validated against `^[A-Za-z0-9_]{1,50}$`.
- `GET /search?type=posts&q=text` performs full-text search on description and username.
- Typeahead endpoints (`/users/search`, `/hashtags/search`) use PostgreSQL trigram similarity (`%` operator) when Meilisearch is absent; Meilisearch when present (up to 8 results).

## Follow Rules

- A user cannot follow themselves (rejected at service layer).
- Follow is idempotent (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`).
- Following a non-existent user returns 404 (verified by CTE before insert).

## Session Expiry Rules

- Sliding TTL: 7 days from last use (refreshed on each authenticated request if within the inner half of the window).
- Absolute TTL: 720 hours (30 days) from creation, configurable via `SESSION_ABSOLUTE_TTL_HOURS`.
- Sessions outside either window are rejected and the cookie is cleared.

## Pagination Rules

- `limit`: 1–50; values > 50 are clamped to 50; default 10.
- `page` parameter is explicitly rejected (400).
- Cursor validity: must be base64url-encoded JSON `{created: timestamp, id: positive int}`.
- Search endpoint cursor encodes a Meilisearch offset (base64 integer string).

## Ordering Guarantees

- Feed, user posts, liked posts, followers, following: `(relevant_timestamp DESC, id DESC)`.
- Comments: `(created DESC, id DESC)`.
- All orderings are stable because `id` is appended as a tiebreaker.
