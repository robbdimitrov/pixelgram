# Phasma Go Backend

The backend is a stateless Go HTTP service built with `net/http` and `pgx`. It
owns users, sessions, posts, comments, likes, and image upload metadata.

## Local Commands

```sh
go run ./cmd/api
go test ./...
make test-integration
go build ./cmd/api
```

Startup fails when PostgreSQL is unavailable or `SESSION_HASH_SECRET` is unset.

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `SESSION_HASH_SECRET`
- `IMAGE_DIR` (optional, defaults to `/tmp`)

## Navigation

- Composition and authentication boundaries: `internal/app/`
- HTTP helpers and middleware: `internal/httpx/`
- Feature modules:
  `internal/{users,sessions,uploads,posts,comments,search,notifications,feed}/`
- Feature-owned PostgreSQL repositories: each feature module's `database.go`
- Shared PostgreSQL lifecycle and resilience configuration:
  `internal/store/database/`
- Reusable retry and circuit-breaking primitives: `internal/resilience/`
- Entrypoint and process lifecycle: `cmd/api/main.go`

Each feature module owns its domain types, repository interface, PostgreSQL
repository implementation, application service, HTTP handler, and route
registration. Handlers parse transport data and map responses; services own
workflows and authorization distinctions.

## PostgreSQL Integration Tests

`make test-integration` starts an ephemeral `postgres:18.4-alpine` container,
applies the real migrations with `migrate/migrate:v4.18.1`, runs the PostgreSQL
repository tests serially, and removes its containers and network on exit.
Database readiness is bounded to 60 seconds and emits container logs on failure.

Database tests compile as part of `go test ./...` and skip when
`PHASMA_TEST_DATABASE_URL` is unset or `-short` is used.

## API Conventions

- JSON request bodies are limited to 100 KB.
- Multipart uploads are limited to 1 MB.
- Errors use JSON message envelopes.
- Authentication uses the `session` cookie.
- Persisted session IDs are HMAC-SHA256 digests using `SESSION_HASH_SECRET`.
