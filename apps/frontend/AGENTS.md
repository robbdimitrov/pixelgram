# Frontend Instructions

These rules extend the repository-level `AGENTS.md` for files under `apps/frontend/`.

## Stack

SvelteKit 2 SSR application using Svelte 5 runes, strict TypeScript, Vite, `@sveltejs/adapter-node`, Tailwind v4, DaisyUI 5, and `@lucide/svelte`.

## Commands

Run from `apps/frontend/`:

```sh
npm run dev
npm run check
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

Use `BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080 npm run dev` to target a locally forwarded backend.

After `npm run build`, run the production SSR bundle locally with:

```sh
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080 node build
```

## Data Flow

- Reads use server `load` functions in `+page.server.ts`.
- Writes use form actions in `+page.server.ts` with `<form method="POST" use:enhance>`.
- Client-driven pagination uses a purposeful per-list `+server.ts` endpoint returning JSON.
- Do not add a generic API proxy or fetch data on component mount.
- Server-side reads and writes go through `apiClient(event)` in `src/lib/server/api/client.ts`, which resolves backend-relative paths against `BACKEND_URL` and forwards only the session cookie. These calls run in the Node server, never the browser, so they never involve CORS.
- The browser must not call the backend directly; it talks only to this SvelteKit server, which is the BFF. CSP `connect-src 'self'` enforces the boundary, which keeps the session cookie `httpOnly`, keeps the backend API off the public surface, and contains XSS exfiltration to this origin.
- Use the central `unwrap<T>()` helper in `src/lib/server/api/http.ts` for API responses. It handles `204 No Content` and non-JSON error bodies; do not call `response.json()` directly.

## Svelte and TypeScript

- Keep strict TypeScript enabled. Prefer `unknown` over `any` and map transport DTOs deliberately.
- Use Svelte 5 runes and SvelteKit primitives already established in the codebase.
- Keep route-specific server behavior in route server files and reusable server API access under `src/lib/server/api/`.
- Use behavior-oriented Vitest tests for mappers, parsing, pagination state, API handling, and other non-trivial logic.

## UI Conventions

- Prefer DaisyUI components and Tailwind utilities in templates.
- Configure themes CSS-first through `@plugin "daisyui/theme"` in `src/app.css`; use `@theme` for custom tokens.
- Use `@lucide/svelte` icons. Add inline SVG only when Lucide cannot represent the symbol.
- Use intentional widths: `max-w-xl` for auth, settings, feed, and single-post flows; `max-w-5xl` for profile grids, upload creation, and app-shell alignment.
- Do not add a dependency when the platform, SvelteKit, or an existing project primitive handles the requirement clearly. Remove direct dependencies that are no longer imported.

## Images and Uploads

- Resize large JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WEBP files before upload, targeting less than 900 KB. The backend still enforces the 1 MB hard limit.
- Upload the file first, then create the image record with `POST /images` using the returned filename.
- Image bytes are served directly by the backend through `/uploads/{key}` and never pass through the Node process.
- Use `imageUrl()` for image paths. CSP keeps `img-src 'self'`.

## SSR and Browser Security

- `@sveltejs/adapter-node` runs the production application as a Node server on port 8080.
- Security headers are set in `src/hooks.server.ts`.
- CSP uses nonce mode configured in `svelte.config.js`. Do not introduce inline scripts without the request nonce.
- Never render user-controlled HTML directly.
- Validate user-controlled `href` and `src` values against an explicit scheme and origin policy.
- The theme helper writes both a cookie and `localStorage`. The nonce-bearing script in `app.html` reads the cookie before paint to avoid FOUC, and `+layout.server.ts` exposes the theme to layout data.
- The container runs as uid 1000 with a read-only root filesystem. The health probe is `/health`.
